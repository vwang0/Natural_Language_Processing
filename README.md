## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**NLP** is the field of AI concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyse large amounts of natural language data.

Before we dive into NLP we need to understand the two types of data that exist: Structured and unstructured.    
Structured data is data that has a pre-defined specific format. For example, spreadsheets, tables, databases   
Unstructured data, on the other hand, is data that doesnâ€™t follow a pre-defined specific format. For example, emails, chats, blogs, books, audio files, video files, images.   


Two parts to NLP: **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** and **Natural Language Generation (NLG)***.    
NLU refers to mapping the given input from Natural Language into formal representation and analysing it.
NLG is the process of producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language from some internal representation. NLG is generally much easier than NLU since
when we know the meaning that needs to be expressed, there are certain rules of language such as syntax and semantics that need to be followed in order to create an appropriate
sentence.
